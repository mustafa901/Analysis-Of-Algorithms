# Printing out the graphs and recognizing the patterns
# 1. Provide a plot of the results of your timing experiment.
# 2. Based on the results of your timing experiment, which algorithm do you think is better? Why?
# 3. Looking at the code for each of the algorithms, explain how each of them works.
# 4. Based on a comparison of the code, why do you think one algorithm performs better than the other?
